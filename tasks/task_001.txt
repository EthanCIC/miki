<info added on 2025-05-06T12:38:49.702Z>
Before creating the Flutter project, we need to install the Flutter SDK:

1. Visit https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install and download the macOS installation package
2. Extract to an appropriate directory, e.g., `~/development/flutter`
3. Add to environment variables by adding `export PATH="$PATH:~/development/flutter/bin"` to `~/.zshrc`
4. Run `source ~/.zshrc` to update environment variables
5. Run `flutter doctor` to check installation and dependencies
6. Resolve any issues shown by `flutter doctor`

After Flutter SDK installation is complete, proceed with initial project creation:
1. Create the Flutter project using the command: `flutter create --org com.chatfirsttodo chat_first_todo`
2. Configure app name and bundle ID
3. Set up essential dependencies in pubspec.yaml
4. Initialize Git repository
5. Create a comprehensive README.md with project overview and setup instructions

Set up platform-specific configurations for iOS (Podfile, Info.plist), Android (build.gradle, AndroidManifest.xml), and Web. Configure platform-specific assets, icons, and splash screens. Test basic build process for each platform.

Completed multi-platform setup:
1. Successfully installed Flutter SDK 3.16.9 (stable version)

3. Configured cross-platform dependencies:
   - flutter_riverpod for state management
   - isar for local database
   - flutter_local_notifications for notifications
   - web_socket_channel for real-time communication
   - Utility libraries: path_provider, http, intl, etc.
4. Established project directory structure:
   - lib/core: Shared utilities
   - lib/data: Data layer (models, repositories)
   - lib/features: Feature modules
   - lib/ui: Shared UI components
   - lib/config: Application configuration

Next steps will focus on setting up Riverpod state management and establishing more detailed class structures before moving to the State Management Implementation subtask.

## 3. State Management Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Implement and configure the chosen state management solution
### Details:
Select and implement a state management approach (e.g., Provider, Bloc, Riverpod). Create base state models, configure dependency injection if needed, and implement sample state flows to validate the approach. Document the state management architecture

Select and implement a state management approach (e.g., Provider, Bloc, Riverpod). Create base state models, configure dependency injection if needed, and implement sample state flows to validate the approach. Document the state management architecture.

Riverpod state management has been implemented with the following components:

1. Basic Riverpod architecture setup:
   - Added ProviderScope in main.dart to enable global state management
   - Replaced standard Widgets with ConsumerWidget to allow state access

2. Key providers implemented:
   - appConfigProvider: Manages environment configurations and feature flags
   - featureProvider: Provides access to feature flags using Provider.family pattern
   - loggerProvider: Global logging utility provider

3. Core state management architecture established:
   - Set up state management for environments and feature flags in config/app_config.dart
   - Implemented Provider pattern as the primary state management approach
   - Created standardized patterns for accessing app configurations and feature flags

4. Testing and validation:
   - Successfully compiled and ran the application, confirming proper Riverpod integration
   - Verified Provider functionality at the UI layer

The application now has a solid foundation for state management that will allow for easy addition of new providers and state management features in future development.

## 4. Directory Structure and Architecture Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.3
### Description: Establish a scalable project directory structure and architecture
### Details:
Create a well-organized directory structure (features, core, shared, etc.). Set up architecture layers (presentation, domain, data). Implement base classes and interfaces. Create style guides and theme configuration. Set up routing system and navigation
<info added on 2025-05-06T14:43:21.355Z>
Create a well-organized directory structure with the following folders:
- config: Application configurations
- core: Core utilities and constants
- data: Data layer (models, repositories, and services)
- features: Feature modules (organized by functionality)
- ui: UI components and theming

Implement a comprehensive theming system:
- iOS-style blue theme
- Support for dark/light mode switching
- Unified typography, spacing, and border radius settings

Set up Riverpod as the state management solution (following the implementation from subtask 1.3)

Define project paths:
- Create Cursor Rule file (.cursor/rules/project_paths.mdc)
- Clearly define all important paths and directory structures
- Provide path usage guidelines to avoid confusion

Remaining tasks:
1. Implement GoRouter routing system to replace basic MaterialApp navigation
2. Establish a base component library
3. Implement unified error handling mechanism
4. Add configuration files to support different environments (development, testing, production)

   - Included route configurations for all application pages
   - Added error handling page routing

3. Created application pages:
   - SplashScreen: Application launch page with animation effects
   - HomeScreen: Main page with feature navigation
   - ChatPage: Chat functionality page
   - TodoListPage: To-do list page
   - ErrorScreen: Error handling page

4. Updated main.dart to use GoRouter:
